in big container, labels get out of it : replace container padding with gauge calculus
config should be relative to the size (x / 300) (or floated to the container's edges, letting space in between?

keep in mind : 
	wide rings must be twice the size of others
	make sizes relative, then add functionality to size down if values > 999

prefix CSS classes with 'gauge-'
non linear scale
add 'mirroring'
add pointerSlowness for 'fill'
have a more modern size for needle?
