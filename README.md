Based on D3, uses SVG


Allow :
	gauge resizes with its container
 	different pointers (needle, thin, filling)
 	different gauge colorations (smooth gradient, gradient by sectors, custom sectors)
 	borders
	different gauge sizes (quarter, half, three quarters and full circles) 
	different labels vs gauge position
 	default config for several gauges
 	efficient updates (no full rerender)
 	
known bugs 
	gauge size calculation only works for mod(90Â°) sizes
