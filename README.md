# WORK IN PROGRESS

Based on D3 and Numbro, uses SVG


## Capabilities

* gauge resizes with its container
* gauge can start and end at any angle
* different pointers style (needle, filament, filling)
* different gauge colorations (smooth gradient, gradient by sectors, custom sectors)
* borders 
* different labels vs gauge position
* default config for not several gauges
* efficient updates (no full rerender)
 	
##CSS classes added to the container

	'gauge-360' for full size gauges
	'gauge-vertical' for half gauges whose layout are vertical
 	
##known bugs 

* pointerSlowness not implmented for 'filled' pointers
